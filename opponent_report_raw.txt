[TEAM OVERVIEW]  
- **Formation(s):** 4-2-3-1 (with wingers)  
- **Tactical Style:** Wing play, slightly more cautious at home, emphasizes getting ball wide early, then crossing.
- **Pressing:** Well above average defending, particularly effective as team unit, especially in second half.
- **Transition:** Leaves players forward on defensive set pieces for counters; commits numbers forward when attacking.
- **Defense:** Marks directly on set pieces, covers both posts, compact and hard to break down especially after halftime.
- **Attack:** Focus on wing play, full-backs look to overlap and cross, midfield creativity (especially through Muniain), wide attackers (both wingers and inverted winger) are key.

[KEY PLAYERS]  

**Unai Simón (GK, Sweeper Keeper)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Exceptional save percentage (95%)  
  - Well above average in clean sheets, key saves, passing/distribution (91% pass completion)  
  - Good at starting counter-attacks from the back  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Poor penalty save record  
  - Can be pressured when pressed during build-up

**Iker Muniain (AMC, Attacking Midfielder)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Strong in creative statistics, key chance creator  
  - Excellent vision and passing  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Not noted for defensive contribution  

**Nico Williams (AMR, Inverted Winger)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - High assist output per 90 minutes  
  - Progressive and key passes among best in the league  
  - High shots on target % (55.56%)  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Below average goal output for his position  
  - May be more dangerous as a provider than as a scorer

**A. Berenguer (AML, Winger)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Provides wing width, outlet for crosses  
  - Supports transitions and overlaps  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Not highlighted as a key creator; can force play wide and double-team

[EXPLOITABLE WEAKNESSES]  
- Team is weaker in the first half; can be vulnerable early before adapting.
- There is a noticeable drop in performance between minutes 70-82—potential for late pressure/subs to exploit fatigue or lapses.
- Heavy reliance on crossing and wing play: blocking crosses and cutting supply lines reduces attacking threat.
- Creative burden falls primarily on Muniain and N. Williams; shutting them down limits their chance creation.
- Goalkeeper (Simón) is poor at saving penalties; attacking the box and winning penalties can be profitable.
- When pressing high, can leave space behind full-backs—potential for quick, direct counter-attacks.
- Leaves players forward on defensive set pieces; may be vulnerable if transition is cut off and quickly recycled.
- Struggles for goals from the right wing (Nico Williams scores less frequently)—force play through him and limit space for assists.

**Summary:**  
Bilbao are a disciplined, defensively solid side with a strong focus on wing play and counter-attacks, improving sharply after halftime but showing vulnerability at the start and in latter stages. Target their penalty area, disrupt wide supply, and look to exploit late-game lapses.

[TEAM OVERVIEW]  
- **Formation(s):** 4-2-3-1 (expected), with inverted wing-backs and wingers (e.g., Berenguer, Yuri, Simón as sweeper keeper)
- **Tactical Style:** Solid defensively, likely organized and structured; moderate creativity in midfield.
- **Pressing:** Moderate—average number of tackles won (72.6%) and possession won (506), suggesting disciplined but not overly aggressive pressing.
- **Transition:** Relatively average, no evidence of extreme counter-press or rapid transition. Low fouls per game (9) and moderate opposition passes per defensive action (4.45), suggesting measured, controlled transitions.
- **Defense:** Very strong—only 0.50 goals conceded per game, 0.73 xGA, and a high number of shutouts. Restricts final third passes against them well (52 per game).
- **Attack:** Relies on a few creative talents but with limited progressive passing. Shoots frequently but creates average assists/opportunities through open play.

[KEY PLAYERS]  
**Iker Muniain**  
- **Position:** Creative Midfielder  
- **Strengths:**  
  - High non-penalty xG per 90 (0.38), indicating threat in advanced positions
  - Above-average shot output (3.05 shots/90)
  - Good pass completion (82.32%), shows secure distribution
  - Generates regular key passes (1.83/90)  
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Below-average progressive passes (2.44/90), meaning playmaking is less incisive than league’s top creators
  - Low open play expected assists (0.08/90)—limited in turning influence into dangerous chances

**Unai Simón**  
- **Position:** Sweeper Keeper  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Consistently involved in defensive shutouts
  - Likely plays an active role in defensive organization
  
**Yuri**  
- **Position:** Inverted Wing-Back  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Supports defense in wide areas, provides cover
  - Likely contributes to possession retention and transitions

**Alex Berenguer**  
- **Position:** Winger  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Provides width, frequently involved in attacking build-up

[EXPLOITABLE WEAKNESSES]
- Relatively average tackling and pressing—patient, precise possession could pull them out of shape.
- Limited creativity and progressive passing from midfield—pressing Muniain could stifle their main source of threat.
- Full-backs may invert often, leaving space behind on quick counters or switch of play to wide areas.
- Few open play assists—tight marking in central areas could reduce their already limited chance creation.
- Rely heavily on key players for creativity—man-marking or disrupting their rhythm can blunt their attacking output.

**Summary:**  
This Athletic Bilbao side is defensively exceptional, disciplined, and prefers structure over risk. Their main creative force, Muniain, is more of a shooting threat than an incisive playmaker. Exploit them by stretching the pitch wide, forcing their full-backs into 1v1 defensive situations, and by targeting their average pressing/transition with confident, patient possession play.
