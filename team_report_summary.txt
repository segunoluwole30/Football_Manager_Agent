[SQUAD SUMMARY]
- Overall squad quality: World-class core; highly skilled first XI with some world-class depth and talented youth, but thin beyond top options.
- Style of play the attributes are suited for: Fast, technical, high-tempo attacking football with wide and central creativity; suitable for gegenpress or possession dominance.
- Physical profile summary: Elite pace, stamina, balance, and agility, especially on the flanks and attack; strong in key defensive positions.
- Technical strengths: Exceptional dribbling, passing, crossing, first touch, technique, long shots; versatile attacking options; superb set-piece takers.
- Technical weaknesses: Set-piece defending (especially near post), aerial duels from wide deliveries, lack of creative passing outside first-choice midfielders.

[KEY PLAYERS]
- Cristiano Ronaldo: Complete Forward/Inside Forward; elite pace, finishing, aerial threat, and off-the-ball; average defensive work, very high wage.
- Gareth Bale: Winger/Inside Forward; speed, direct running, crossing, shooting from range; limited defensive discipline, high injury risk.
- Luka Modric: Advanced Playmaker; vision, passing, agility, ball retention; physical strength and aerial ability are below average.
- Sergio Ramos: Center-Back/Right-Back; leadership, tackling, heading, versatility; suspension/injury risk, occasional lapses in composure.
- Ángel Di María: Winger/Playmaker; dribbling, crossing, high work rate, strong recent form; only moderate finishing and decision-making.
- Iker Casillas: Sweeper Keeper; reflexes, anticipation, distribution, command of area; aging, slight limitations in kicking/outside-box sweeping.

[TACTICAL FIT]
- Best formations for this squad (pick 2): 4-2-3-1 Wide / 4-3-3 DM Wide.
- Pressing suitability: High.
- Tempo suitability: High.
- Defensive line suitability: High/Medium-high line.
- Transition strengths: Deadly counterattacks, quick vertical play, aggressive pressing, overlapping fullbacks.
- Transition weaknesses: Vulnerable to fast breaks behind defense, aerial/set-piece lapses, gaps if fullbacks caught high.

[SQUAD ISSUES]
- Depth problems: Significant drop-off outside top XI in midfield/defense; left-back and striker cover thin despite some utility options.
- Injury risks: Bale, Alonso, Modric prone to fatigue and increased injuries.
- Players out of position: Some rotation players (Nacho, Borja) lack full suitability for tactical demands.
- Major tactical incompatibilities: Wage structure limits transfer flexibility; overlapping fullbacks can expose spaces behind; set-piece marking inconsistent.

[RECOMMENDATION]
- Best overall tactical style to use: High-pressing, attacking 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 (gegenpress with aggressive fullbacks and fluid front four).
- 1–2 alternative tactical styles: Controlled possession (slower 4-3-3 with deep playmaker); direct counter-attacking 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 in big away games.
