[TEAM OVERVIEW]
- Primary formations: 4-2-3-1, occasionally 4-3-3.
- Tactical style: Focuses on wing play and direct counter-attacks, prioritizes width and early crosses over patient possession.
- Pressing intensity: Organised high press; more intense in the second half.
- Defensive line: Maintains a medium-to-high line, compact after halftime.
- Possession tendencies: Prefers quick transitions and wide play; rarely dominates possession.
- Transition habits: Commits numbers forward on attack; leaves forwards high on defensive set pieces for counters.

[KEY PLAYERS]
- Unai Simón: GK, exceptional shot-stopper and distributor; struggles with penalties, can be forced into errors if pressed.
- Iker Muniain: AMC, primary creator with vision and key passes; minimal defensive workrate.
- Nico Williams: AMR, inverted winger, high on assists and progressive passes, less goal threat; best as a provider.
- Álex Berenguer: AML, offers width and overlapping runs; not standout as creator, occasionally forced wide.
- Yuri: LB, supports in possession and overlaps; may leave space behind when advancing.

[STRENGTHS]
- Highly organized and difficult to break down defensively, especially after halftime.
- Effective wing play and overlapping full-backs generate dangerous crosses.
- Strong at launching counters, especially from defensive set pieces.
- Key players (Muniain, Nico Williams) drive creative threats, particularly in wide/half-space areas.

[WEAKNESSES]
- Vulnerable early in matches and after 70', with lapses and fatigue.
- Set-piece defense can be exposed if counter is intercepted.
- Reliance on Muniain/Nico Williams for creativity—limiting them restricts attack.
- Poor penalty save record for Simón.
- Spaces left by advancing full-backs vulnerable to quick switches or counters.

[WHAT TO EXPECT IN MATCH]
- Expected attacking behavior: Fast wide play, frequent crosses, full-back overlaps, direct counters.
- Expected defensive behavior: Compact block, improved discipline second half, marks tightly on set pieces.
- Expected speed of play: Quick transitions, fast tempo in wide areas.
- Key danger areas: Flanks, especially late crosses and cutbacks.

[HOW TO EXPLOIT THEM]
- Target early and late match periods with aggressive pressing and fresh legs.
- Block crosses and force play inside to limit wide threats.
- Exploit space behind full-backs with quick wide runners or diagonal balls.
- Press Simón and backline on the ball to force distribution errors.
- Attack the box to draw fouls; pursue penalty opportunities.
- Man-mark or congest space around Muniain and Nico Williams to stifle creativity.
