[TEAM OVERVIEW]
- Primary formations: 4-1-2-3 (single pivot, two advanced midfielders, wide wingers, lone striker).
- Tactical style: Cautious, wing-focused play; attack prioritizes wide areas and early crossing, especially away from home.
- Pressing intensity: Moderate; not aggressive high press, prefer to absorb and break quickly.
- Defensive line: Standard, with full-backs supporting attacks but vulnerable if caught forward.
- Possession tendencies: Comfortable in possession, especially through the deep-lying midfielder; look to build through wings and overload flanks.
- Transition habits: Commit numbers forward in attack; leave attackers upfield in defensive phases to spring counters.

[KEY PLAYERS]
- Guillermo Sara: goalkeeper; solid shot-stopper, strong box presence, faces high workload under pressure.
- Javi Chica: right-back; major contributor to wing buildup, strong passing, can be exposed on counters behind him.
- Antonio Amaya: center-back; initiates play from the back, reliable passer, prone to errors under pressing.
- Xavi Torres: defensive midfielder; controls tempo and distribution, key link in buildup, vulnerable if pressed.
- Rubén Castro: inside forward/winger; main goal threat cutting in, decisive finisher, can become isolated left side.

[STRENGTHS]
- Dangerous wide play with frequent overlapping runs and early crosses.
- Composed in possession; patient buildup, especially through central defensive midfielder.
- Well-organized set piece defense; direct man-marking, both posts covered.
- Retain attackers upfield for counter-attacks.

[WEAKNESSES]
- Vulnerable to fast counters when full-backs are advanced.
- Heavily reliant on wide areas; predictable if denied flank access.
- Weak link between left-back and inside forward—potential disconnect in attack and defense.
- Deep playmaker (Torres) can be pressured into errors.
- Defenders prone to mistakes under high press; set-piece defending susceptible to overloads.

[WHAT TO EXPECT IN MATCH]
- Expected attacking behavior: Build through flanks with overlaps, frequent crossing, focus on getting wingers isolated.
- Expected defensive behavior: Cautious shape, focused on blocking central access but susceptible on transitions.
- Expected speed of play: Moderate; quick transitions but deliberate buildup.
- Key danger areas: Wide channels, especially right flank; inside forward cutting inside.

[HOW TO EXPLOIT THEM]
- Press the deep-lying midfielder aggressively to disrupt buildup.
- Target the space behind attacking full-backs with quick wingers or overlapping runs.
- Overload flanks and block crosses to stifle their attacking routes.
- Counter swiftly after turnovers, exploiting defensive gaps left by advanced players.
- Direct set pieces and near-post overloads to challenge man-marking scheme.
- Attack the weak link between their left-back and inside forward.
